# Hands Dirty Boilerplate

#### A simple boilerplate containing the bare tools you need to help you jump straight into rapid prototyping
This boilerplate, mostly based on [Zurb Foundation 4](http://foundation.zurb.com/), is designed to let you get your hands dirty when you have an idea. 

## Projects included in the boilerplate
* [Zurb Foundation 4](http://foundation.zurb.com/) (the basis for grid and styling)
* [responsive-nav](http://responsive-nav.com) by [Viljami Salminen](http://viljamis.com) (because Foundation's nav can be a little fussy and responsive-nav allows you to ship your final idea with production code without any dependencies)
* [appendAround](http://https://github.com/filamentgroup/AppendAround) by [Scott Jehl](http://scottjehl.com/). This is a great tool to allow you to swap elements around in your markup
